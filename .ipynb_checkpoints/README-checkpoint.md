# SP_blog

This will become a personal blog dealing mainly with topic about mathematical optimization.

At the moment its mainly about how to build a blog with nbdev and quarto and publish it on github.
As the documentation for these three tools is exhaustive, the corresponding blog post aggregate what was relevant for myself.



## local setup

I use conda for environment management and poetry for package management.

```
conda env create -f --name [your enviroment names] environment.yml
conda activate [your enviroment names]
poetry install
```
