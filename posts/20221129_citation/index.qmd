# Footnotes

## input

````
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.
[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
````

**Remark:** The content of the footnote, e.g. ```[^1]: Here is the footnote.``` can be placed anywhere in the document. I usually put it at the end of the document, because some footnotes are used more than once.

## inline footnote

Here is an inline note.^[Inlines notes are easier to write,
since you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to
type the note.]

# initial setup citation

**Remark:** In the following setup the bibliography is maintained in a `references.bib` file and there is no need to add `bibliography: references.bib` to the YAML medadata field of the document.

1. add `bibliography: references.bib``to `_quarto.yml`
1. add to root directory of the repository a `references.bib` file with content
````
---
title: References
---

::: {#refs}
:::
````
1. add to root directory of the repository a `references.bib` file and add (or any 
````
@article{knuth84,
  author = {Knuth, Donald E.},
  title = {Literate Programming},
  year = {1984},
  journal = {Comput. J.},
  pages = {97â€“111}
}
````

1. test by simply put `@knuth84` in a blog document and call `quarto preview` for example from a conda prompt.

**remark:** Here knuth84 is the unique identifier in the citation database `references.bib`

# workflow

## Bibliography Generation

Supose you want to add a new reference to your citation database `references.bib`, e.g. [@trotta2022pickup]. I usually do the following:

a. open google scholar
a. search for your reference, e.g. "trotta routing on a ring"
a. use the nice link "citation" below the hit of google scholar and choose `BibTex` next
a. simply copy and paste the content to your `references.bib` file. The copied content will look like:
````
@article{trotta2022pickup,
  title={Pickup and delivery problems with autonomous vehicles on rings},
  author={Trotta, Manuel and Archetti, Claudia and Feillet, Dominique and Quilliot, Alain},
  journal={European Journal of Operational Research},
  volume={300},
  number={1},
  pages={221--236},
  year={2022},
  publisher={Elsevier}
}
````

## Add a citation in a blog document

- Markdown format for citation is `[@citation]`
- Given example: `[@trotta2022pickup]` renders to [@trotta2022pickup]
- There are other markdown format for citation, e.g. `@trotta2022pickup` renders to @trotta2022pickup. For more information just have a look at the sources below.
